1) *DONE* allow emitters on outside of ship only
2) complete shield damage scaling and power usage algorthim
3) shield power effiecy by ditance from reactors or relays.
4) control block and readouts
5) *DONE* finish small ship and station blocks.
6) fix auto size adjustment corner cases
7) require emitters to be within range from other emitters to complete a combined (larger) field.
8) support forward, back, left, right, top and bottom shields.
9) Finish and test Multiplayer
10) Add damage shield block.
11) Add particle effects to the actual shield verts/triangles.  Perhaps even impact animations.
12) Add a toggle for owner to disable idle shield state visability.
13) ModAPI support (must get Line Ellispoid working).
14) Confirm unloading of mod properly.
15) Limit placement of station/LargeShip on their respective grids.
16) In game game state messages.
17) try and find a better point to applyforce against, perhaps use distance and face check.
